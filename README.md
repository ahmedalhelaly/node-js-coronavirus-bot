# node-js-coronavirus-bot

It is my first project with Node Js. 
I was inspired by an idea I saw on facebook to create
this simple Messenger Chat Bot to help people keep updated with latest statistics.

- You can subscribe to get updates for your chosen country (or continent).
- You can also get current statistics for any country (or continent) by just sending its name.

Feel free to send any feedback or suggestions. It will definitely help me a lot.
